# React Mini Projects

This repository contains mini projects built while learning React. Each project focuses on practicing and understanding key React concepts such as:

- **Components:** Building reusable UI elements.
- **Props and State:** Managing data flow and component state.
- **Hooks:** Using `useState`, `useEffect`, and other React hooks for functional components.
- **Event Handling:** Managing user interactions.
- **Routing:** Navigation using React Router.
- **Context API:** Managing global state without prop drilling.
- **API Integration:** Fetching and displaying data from APIs.
- **Styling:** Applying styles with CSS modules, inline styles, and libraries like TailwindCSS.
- **Forms and Validation:** Building and handling forms with validation.
- **Performance Optimization:** Techniques like memoization and lazy loading.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Understanding component lifecycles in class components.

These projects are for personal learning, but feel free to explore and clone them to learn alongside me.
